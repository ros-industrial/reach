## Description

The REACH repository is a tool that allows users to visualize and quantitatively evaluate the reach capability of
a robot system for a given workpiece.

The package is comprised of several packages:
- `reach_msgs`
  - Message definitions for the reach study
- `reach_core`
  - Core code to operate the reach study
  - Interfaces for plugins
    - Inverse kinematics solver
    - Robot pose evaluator
    - Reach Display
- `moveit_reach_plugins`
  - Implementations of the plugin interfaces built on the MoveIt! planning framework

## Installation

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-industrial/reach.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
catkin build
```

## Demo

A simple demonstration of the capability of this repository is provided in the `reach_demo` package. See the [instructions](reach_demo/README.md) for details on how to run the demo.

## Usage

1. Create a URDF of your robot system
1. Create a launch file to load the URDF, SRDF, and other required parameters (e.g. related to kinematics, joint, limits) to the parameter server
1. Create a mesh model of the workpiece
1. Create a point cloud of the target points on the workpiece
    - This point cloud can be generated using a command line tool from PCL 1.8:
      ```
      pcl_mesh_sampling <workpiece_mesh>.ply <output_cloud>.pcd -n_samples <number of samples> -leaf_size <leaf_size> -write_normals true
      ```
1. Create a configuration YAML file (see example in config directory)
1. Run the setup launch file
    ```
    roslaunch reach_core setup.launch robot:=<load_robot_parameters>.launch
    ```
1. Run the reach study analysis
    ```
    roslaunch reach_core start.launch config_file:=<config_file.yaml> config_name:=<arbitrary_config>
    ```
