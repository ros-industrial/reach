# MoveIt! REACH Plugins

This package contains the plugin implemenations of REACH kinematics, evaluation, and display interfaces

## Evaluation Plugins

### Manipulability

This plugin uses MoveIt! to calculate the manipulability of a robot pose. Higher manipulability results in higher pose score. Range: [0, inf)

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - The name of the planning group with which to evaluate the manipulability of a given robot pose
- **`jacobian_row_subset`** (optional)
  - The indices of the rows of the Jacobian to use when evaluating the manipulability. The row indices should be on [0, 6) and correspond to the output space [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz]
  - Ex. `jacobian_row_subset: [0, 1, 2]  # position manipulability only`

### Manipulability Ratio

This plugin uses MoveIt! to calculate the manipulability of a robot pose and evaluate a score. The score is calculated as the ratio of the smallest manipulability value to the largest manipulability value.
The larger this ratio, the more uniform the dexterity and the higher the score. Range [0, 1]

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - The name of the planning group with which to evaluate the manipulability of a given robot pose
- **`jacobian_row_subset`** (optional)
  - The indices of the rows of the Jacobian to use when evaluating the manipulability. The row indices should be on [0, 6) and correspond to the output space [x, y, z, rx, ry, rz]
  - Ex. `jacobian_row_subset: [0, 1, 2]  # position manipulability only`

### Distance Penalty

This plugin uses the MoveIt! collision environment to calculate the distance to closest collision
for a robot pose. That distance value is then used to score the robot pose. Larger distance to closest collision
results in higher pose score. Range: [0, inf)

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - The name of the planning group to be used to solve the robot's inverse kinematics
- **`distance_threshold`**
  - The distance between 2 closest surfaces to collision under which an inverse kinematics solution will be considered invalid
- **`collision_mesh_filename`**
  - The filename (in ROS package URI format) of the reach object mesh to be used to do collision checking
  - Example: `package://<your_package>/<folder>/<filename>.stl
- **`collision_mesh_frame`**
  - The name of the TF frame in which the collision mesh of the reach object should be placed
- **`touch_links`**
  - The names of the robot links with which the reach object mesh is allowed to collide
- **`exponent`**
  - score = (closest_distance_to_collision - distance_threshold)^exponent.

### Joint Penalty

This plugin uses the MoveIt! robot model to calculate a robot pose score based on how much the pose deviates
from the center of the joint range. Robot poses that are closer to the center of the joint range result in higher pose scores. Range: [0, 1]

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - The name of the planning_group with which to evaluate the joint penalty

## IK Solvers

### MoveIt! IK Solver

This plugin uses MoveIt! kinematics solvers and collision checking to produce collision aware IK solutions

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - Name of the planning group
- **`distance_threshold`**
  - The distance from nearest collision at which to invalidate an IK solution. For example, if this parameter is
  set to 0.1m, then IK solutions whose distance to nearest collision is less than 0.1m will be invalidated
- **`collision_mesh_filename`**
  - The file path to the collision mesh model of the workpiece, in the `package://` or 'file://' URI format
- **`collision_mesh_frame`**
  - The TF frame of reference of the collision mesh
- **`touch_links`**
  - The TF links that are allowed to be in contact with the collision mesh
- **`evaluation_plugin`**
  - The name (and parameters) of the evaluation plugin to be used to score IK solution poses

### Discretized MoveIt! IK Solver

This plugin performs the same function as the MoveIt! IK solver plugin above, but calculates IK solutions for
a target that has been discretized about its Z-axis by an input angle. The pose with the best score is returned.

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - Name of the planning group
- **`distance_threshold`**
  - The distance from nearest collision at which to invalidate an IK solution. For example, if this parameter is
  set to 0.1m, then IK solutions whose distance to nearest collision is less than 0.1m will be invalidated
- **`collision_mesh_filename`**
  - The file path to the collision mesh model of the workpiece, in the `package://` or 'file://' URI format
- **`collision_mesh_frame`**
  - The TF frame of reference of the collision mesh
- **`touch_links`**
  - The TF links that are allowed to be in contact with the collision mesh
- **`evaluation_plugin`**
  - The name (and parameters) of the evaluation plugin to be used to score IK solution poses
- **`discretization_angle`**
  - The angle (between 0 and pi, in radians) with which to sample each target pose about the Z-axis

## Display Plugins

### MoveIt! Reach Display

This plugin uses the MoveIt! planning environment framework to display the results of the reach study

Parameters:

- **`planning_group`**
  - Name of the planning group
- **`collision_mesh_filename`**
  - The file path to the collision mesh model of the workpiece, in the `package://` or 'file://' URI format
- **`collision_mesh_frame`**
  - The TF frame of reference of the collision mesh
- **`fixed_frame`**
  - The fixed TF frame in which to display the interactive markers
- **`marker_scale`**
  - The length (in meters) of the arrow markers representing the target Cartesian points
